# Monster Madness
This data pack dials the dungeon (monster room) spawner settings up to 11.

My aims:
* Maintain a vanilla feel
* Increase challenge
* Improve rewards

This is a homage to a very old Minecraft mod that achieved this 10 years ago!


## Installation

Because of how this data pack modifies world generation it is best installed at creation time.

* *Create New World*
* *More*, *Data Packs*
* *Open Pack Folder*
* Copy in the whole *monstermadness* directory


> [!WARNING]  
> World generation is notably slower with this pack installed, but fun is increased.
> This has not been tested on a low spec system.
